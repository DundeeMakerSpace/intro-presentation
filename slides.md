## What is a MakerSpace?


> community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialise and/or collaborate

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makerspace)

Note:
1. A Community Centre with tools
2. Combining manufacturing equipment with the community and education
3. Members will design, prototype and create manufactured works that would not be possible to create alone.
4. People from different creative backgrounds and experience to collaborate on exciting projects.


## Global network

Note:
1. Over 1200 worldwide
2. They are typically called Hacker spaces
3. We opted for MakerSpace as unfortunately the original definition of a hacker has been contorted by the media

### Our vision

> Dundee MakerSpace aims to be a community workshop and part of the global drive to encourage everyone to be creative, bringing people together into an environment to learn and collaborate on great ideas and exciting projects.


### Our ethics

- Openness
- Nonprofit Organisation

Note:
1. Community managed and open to anyone to join and be creative
2. We will most likely be a Company Limited by Guarantee
3. We want the benefit of Corporate status, limited liability for members, enter into contract and purchase assets
4. The surplus profits will be reinvested.
5. HAND OVER TO GRANT
